This crawler is a prototype and was developed to gather informations about degrees
offered by institutes in Iceland from Anabin.

It requests Anabin and parses the response html.
The Result will be written as CSV.
The writing process needs some more work, because of some charactes
the CSV is breaking some cases and creates new columns and/or rows.

To run the script you need Python installed.
Run anabinCrawler.py via console to create the CSV file.
